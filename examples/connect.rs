//! This example demonstrates how to make connection using `crust`.  We are using `crust::Service`
//! to listen for incoming connections and to establish connection to remote peer.
//!
//! In a nutshell connetion looks like this:
//!
//! 1. start listening for incoming connections
//! 2. prepare connection information: public and private
//! 3. exchange public information
//! 4. connect
//!
//! Run two instances of this sample: preferably on separate computers but localhost is fine too.
//! When the sample starts it prints generated public information which is represented as JSON
//! object.  Copy this object from first to second peer and hit ENTER.  Do the same with the second
//! peer: copy it's public information JSON to first peer and hit ENTER.
//! On both peers you should see something like:
//! ```
//! Connected to peer: 4a755684f72fe63fba86725b80d42d69ed649392
//! ```
//! That's it, it means we successfully did a peer-to-peer connection.
